# Daily Expense Tracker (CLI)

A simple command-line daily expense tracking application written in Python.

This project allows users to record daily expenses, view all recorded expenses, calculate total and average spending, and clear all expenses through a menu-driven interface.

## Features
- Add a new expense
- View all expenses
- Calculate total and average expense
- Clear all expenses
- Handle invalid menu choices gracefully

## How It Works
The application runs in a continuous loop and waits for the user to select an option from the menu. Based on the selected option, it performs the corresponding action until the user chooses to exit.

## How to Run
Make sure you have Python 3 installed, then run:

```bash
python expense_tracker.py

Technologies Used
Python 3

## Notes
This project is part of my learning process to improve my Python programming skills and understanding of basic control flow, user input handling, and data structures.
