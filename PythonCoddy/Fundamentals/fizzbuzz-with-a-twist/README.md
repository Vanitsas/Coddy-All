FizzBuzz with a Twist
Description

This project is a step-by-step Python implementation of the classic FizzBuzz problem.
It is designed to practice basic control flow, functions, and loops in Python.

An additional rule called "Almost Fizz" is included:
If a number contains the digit 3 but is not divisible by 3 or 7, it prints "Almost Fizz".

Rules

Divisible by 3 → "Fizz"

Divisible by 7 → "Buzz"

Divisible by both 3 and 7 → "FizzBuzz"

Contains the digit 3 but not divisible by 3 or 7 → "Almost Fizz"

Otherwise → prints the number itself

How to Run

Make sure Python 3 is installed

Navigate to the project folder in your terminal or IDE

Run the program:

python fizzbuzz.py


Enter a number when prompted. For example, 20

Notes / Tips

The function design makes it easy to modify or extend the rules

This project is small but a good example to demonstrate basic Python skills
